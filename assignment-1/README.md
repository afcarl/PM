Assignment 1:
The goal of this assignment is to give you a concrete understanding of the Tenenbaum (1999) work by implementing and experimenting with a small scale version of the model applied to learning concepts in two-dimensional spaces.
The further goal is to get hands-on experience representing and manipulating probability distributions and using Bayes' rule.
